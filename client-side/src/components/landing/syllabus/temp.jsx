          preparation is to scan the CAT Syllabus 2018. In fact, CAT Exam
          Syllabus has never had any boundaries and this fact also applies to
          define the CAT 2018 exam syllabus. CAT 2018 exam syllabus is based on
          the past trend of CAT exams and putting it the right way, the CAT
          syllabus is the outcome of the topics which have earlier appeared in
          CAT exam although the type of questions, their composition, format,
          and number may change in each subsequent CAT exam.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key point in CAT exam syllabus 2018 is that there is no repetition
          of CAT questions in any CAT exam although difficulty level of the
          questions in the CAT exam would not go out of CAT exam syllabus. IIM
          entrance exam syllabus or CAT 2018 exam Syllabus is not pre-defined by

          by the CAT exam convening IIM Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Indore, Kozhikode
          or Lucknow.
