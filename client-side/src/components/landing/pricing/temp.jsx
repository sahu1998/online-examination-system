          The key point in CAT exam syllabus 2018 is that there is no repetition
          of CAT questions in any CAT exam although difficulty level of the
          questions in CAT exam would not go out of CAT exam syllabus. IIM
          entrance exam syllabus or CAT 2018 exam Syllabus is not pre-defined by
          CAT 2018 convening IIM nor the CAT syllabus was outlined earlier also
          by the CAT exam convening IIM Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Indore, Kozhikode
          or Lucknow.
